## Coverage Impact Estimation

Based on component complexity and line counts:

| Component            | Estimated Lines | Test Coverage | Impact |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| AIImageGenerator     | ~485 lines      | 95%+          | +6.5%  |
| VideoGenerationPanel | ~537 lines      | 90%+          | +6.8%  |
| AssetBrowser         | ~424 lines      | 90%+          | +5.4%  |
| video-studio.tsx     | ~1,254 lines    | 70%+          | +12.5% |
| clients.tsx          | ~895 lines      | 70%+          | +8.9%  |

**Total Estimated Coverage Increase: ~40%**
**New Projected Coverage: 46.8% (from 6.8% baseline)**
