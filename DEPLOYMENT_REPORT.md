## üéØ Deployment Summary

The AIrWAVE platform has been successfully deployed to Netlify with all core backend APIs implemented and functioning correctly. The application demonstrates:

- ‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture**: Next.js with API routes
- ‚úÖ **Secure Authentication**: JWT-based with middleware protection
- ‚úÖ **Database Integration**: Supabase with RLS policies
- ‚úÖ **External API Integration**: Creatomate rendering service
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive APIs**: 70+ endpoints for creative workflow management
- ‚úÖ **Production Deployment**: Netlify with proper build pipeline

The platform is ready for frontend integration and advanced feature implementation. The core creative workflow engine is operational and can handle the complete brief-to-execution pipeline.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Stage 2A (Frontend Integration) to connect the new APIs with user interfaces.
