# Quick Fix for Netlify Routing Issue

## Changes Made:

1. **Updated Homepage** (`src/pages/index.tsx`)
   - No longer auto-redirects to /assets
   - Shows a proper landing page with login button
   - Only redirects if user is already authenticated

2. **Updated Middleware** (`src/middleware.ts`)
   - Added '/' (root path) to public routes
   - Prevents authentication loop

## Test These URLs:

1. Homepage: https://airwave2.netlify.app/
   - Should show landing page with login button

2. Login page: https://airwave2.netlify.app/login
   - Should show login form

3. Health check: https://airwave2.netlify.app/api/health
   - Should return health status

## If Still Having Issues:

Try clearing your browser cache or opening in incognito mode. The redirect loop might be cached.

## Demo Credentials:

Since the app uses mock data, you can use any email/password combination to log in:
- Email: demo@example.com
- Password: any password

The authentication is currently mocked since the code review showed all APIs use mock data instead of real Supabase integration.
