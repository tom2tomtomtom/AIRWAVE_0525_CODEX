# Claude Code Safety Rules for AIRWAVE Project

## CRITICAL: Read claude.md first!

## Automated Response Rules:
- REFUSE: Any request to "fix all" errors across multiple files
- REFUSE: Creating scripts that modify multiple files
- REFUSE: Global find/replace operations
- WARNING: Before any regex operations
- WARNING: Before any dependency updates
- CONFIRM: Before modifying more than 50 lines

## Required Response Format:
Every code change must include:
1. Risk Assessment (Low/Medium/High)
2. Files that will be modified (exact list)
3. What could go wrong
4. How to test the change
5. Rollback instructions

## Safe Patterns:
- Single file modifications only
- Incremental changes with testing
- Clear commit messages
- Frequent backups

## Project Context:
- Owner is non-technical
- Previous disaster from automated fixes
- 6000+ errors were created by AI "improvements"
- Safety is more important than speed
