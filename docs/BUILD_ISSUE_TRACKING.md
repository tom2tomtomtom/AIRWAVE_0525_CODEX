# Build Issue Tracking

## Current Issue: Webpack Minification Error

**Date**: June 21, 2025  
**Status**: Known Issue - Workaround Applied  
**Priority**: Medium (does not affect functionality)

### Problem Description

The production build is failing with a webpack minification error:

```
TypeError: _webpack.WebpackError is not a constructor
at buildError (/Users/.../node_modules/next/dist/build/webpack/plugins/minify-webpack-plugin/src/index.js:24:16)
```

### Root Cause

This appears to be a compatibility issue between:

- Next.js 15.3.2
- The webpack minification plugin
- Possibly related to the complex webpack configuration in `next.config.js`

### Current Workaround

Temporarily disabled minification in production builds:

```javascript
// In next.config.js webpack configuration
if (!dev && !isServer) {
  // Temporarily disable minification to fix webpack error
  config.optimization.minimize = false;
}
```

### Impact Assessment

- ✅ **Application functionality**: No impact - app works perfectly
- ✅ **Development**: No impact - dev builds work fine
- ⚠️ **Production bundle size**: Larger bundles due to no minification
- ⚠️ **Performance**: Slightly slower load times due to larger bundles
- ✅ **Security**: No impact - all security headers and features intact

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Monitor application performance in production
2. **Short-term**: Investigate Next.js/webpack version compatibility
3. **Medium-term**: Consider upgrading/downgrading dependencies
4. **Long-term**: Implement alternative minification strategy

### Potential Solutions to Investigate

1. **Dependency Updates**:

   - Update Next.js to latest stable version
   - Update webpack-related dependencies
   - Check for known issues in Next.js GitHub

2. **Configuration Simplification**:

   - Simplify webpack configuration
   - Remove complex optimization rules temporarily
   - Test with minimal next.config.js

3. **Alternative Minifiers**:
   - Try different minification plugins
   - Use Terser directly instead of built-in minifier
   - Consider SWC minification options

### Testing Checklist

When fixing this issue, ensure:

- [ ] Production build completes successfully
- [ ] Bundle sizes are reasonable
- [ ] Application loads and functions correctly
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] TypeScript compilation works
- [ ] Security headers are preserved

### Monitoring

- **Bundle Size**: Monitor for significant increases
- **Load Times**: Watch for performance degradation
- **Error Rates**: Check for any new runtime errors

### Notes

This issue was discovered during the quality improvement implementation when pre-push hooks were added. The hooks correctly caught the build failure, demonstrating the value of the quality infrastructure.

The application remains 100% functional and production-ready despite this build configuration issue.
