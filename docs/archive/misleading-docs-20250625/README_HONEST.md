# AIRWAVE - AI Video Marketing Platform

**Current Status: 🚨 DEVELOPMENT/BROKEN**

## What This Project Is

AIRWAVE is intended to be an AI-powered video marketing platform built with:

- Next.js 14.2.5
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- Supabase for backend
- Material-UI v7 for components
- Integration with AI services (OpenAI, ElevenLabs)

## ⚠️ Current Reality

**This project currently does not work.** Key issues:

### Compilation Broken

```bash
npm run type-check
# Fails with 50+ TypeScript syntax errors
```

### Tests Broken

```bash
npm test
# Cannot run due to compilation failures
```

### Build Broken

```bash
npm run build
# Fails due to TypeScript errors
```

### Example of Broken Code

```typescript
// From src/components/BriefUploadModal.tsx (line 91)
accept: { }                    // ❌ Missing opening brace
  'application/pdf': ['.pdf'], // ❌ Broken object syntax
  'text/plain': ['.txt']},     // ❌ Orphaned closing brace
```

## 🛠️ To Get Started (For Developers)

1. **Check actual status:**

   ```bash
   npm run type-check  # See all compilation errors
   npm test           # See test failures
   ```

2. **Start fixing syntax:**
   - Fix object literal syntax in components
   - Fix TypeScript errors systematically
   - Get basic compilation working first

3. **Work incrementally:**
   - Fix one file at a time
   - Test compilation after each fix
   - Don't add features until basics work

## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
├── components/     # React components (mostly broken syntax)
├── pages/         # Next.js pages (some work, some broken)
├── lib/           # Utility libraries (mixed quality)
├── utils/         # Helper functions (some functional)
└── types/         # TypeScript types (mostly OK)
```

## 🚫 What NOT to Trust

- Any documentation claiming this is "production ready"
- Any reports about "comprehensive testing"
- Any security assessments (code doesn't run)
- Any performance benchmarks
- Any deployment guides

## ✅ What Actually Works

- Basic Next.js setup
- Some utility functions
- Dependency management
- Project structure concepts

## 🎯 Realistic Development Plan

### Week 1: Basic Functionality

- [ ] Fix TypeScript compilation errors
- [ ] Get tests running
- [ ] Fix core component syntax

### Week 2-3: Core Features

- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Basic UI components
- [ ] Database integration

### Week 4-6: AI Integration

- [ ] File upload and processing
- [ ] AI service integration
- [ ] Video generation pipeline

### Week 7-8: Testing & Polish

- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Error handling
- [ ] Performance optimization

## 🔧 Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Check what's broken
npm run type-check

# Start fixing...
# (No point running dev server until compilation works)
```

## 🤝 Contributing

If you want to help fix this:

1. Start with TypeScript errors: `npm run type-check`
2. Fix one file at a time
3. Test compilation after each change
4. Don't add new features until existing code compiles

## ⚠️ Important Note

**Do not use this code in production.** It currently has fundamental syntax errors that prevent compilation. All previous claims about it being "ready" were premature.

This is a development project that needs significant work before it can be considered functional, let alone production-ready.
